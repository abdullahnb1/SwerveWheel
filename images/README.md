## dc_motor_bed - dc_motor_bed_2: 
This part is basicly for the implementation of the dc motor. In this part, we wanted to hide the cables for the motor and simultaneously want it to be small and modular. The encoder must be far away from the bed design, also it could be a tight match.

## Gears: 
We have used 1:1 ratio gears. The important part for the gears is that one of the gears also has a tight match with the rotation_piece so that it can rotate the wheels in an axis.

## legs_connection_part: 
This one is the most complicated part, due to the number of pieces that connected  to it. Legs should be small and modular alsoit should allow the cables to flow inside. Due to the size of the part making this piece small was creating problems. Hence we have subtract some partsfrom the legs. This features have some advantages. Hence we have created this robot by using additive production, taking out the supports become easier. Also the production time have been decreased. Right and left legs can be differ from each other. We have used one right and one left legs for one side. This makes our robot slightly larger.

## rotation_piece: 
We needed the rotation piece to rotate from 0 to 180 degrees while it allows the cables to low inside it. Also it needed to be connect with the gears and dc motor bedto rotate the wheels.,

## sigma_connector: 
Sigma connecter used  to connect the legs to the chassismade from the sigma frames. Now we use also 3D chassis due to the weight of the sigma frames.
