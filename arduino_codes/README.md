# Codes

In this directory, you can find detailed codes for teh robot. Every code pages we write during the test stages of the project.

## dc_motor: 
We tried the dc motor whether it is working under the weight of the vehicle.


## dc_motor_p_control:
We have added the P control as in PID to the dc_motor codes we have previously used.


## dc_motor_rpm_read:
We have now trying to control the dc motor with the revolution it has done. In this particular code we read the rpm values from the encoder  embeded on the dc motor.


## encoder:
We try the encoder whether it is working okay or not.


## millis_deneme:
In the previous codes we have tried so far we have an issue from the arduino that we do not understand. It wasdue to we were trying to start the servo and the dc motor togather. Hence we have solved the issue with the millis() function in the arduino.,


## servo_dc_ortak_deneme: 
We embeded the servo_deneme and the dc_motor_p_control codes togather to see how they are working togather.


## servo_deneme:
This is the code which we used for the servo if it is working or not.


## the_code:
This is the actual file we used in the final robot.
